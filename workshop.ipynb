The radiologist needs to analyze the [MRI](#mri-imaging) images of the patient's lumbar spine and to classify the different spine degenerative conditions and their severity. This process is very subjective and can be affected by the radiologist's experience, knowledge, and mood.\n",

    "Our data contains MRI images with the following sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sagittal T2/STIR**\n",
    "    - Sagittal Plane: This refers to the plane of imaging that divides the body into left and right halves. When imaging is done in the sagittal plane, the images show slices of the body from the side.\n",
    "    - T2-weighted (T2): T2-weighted imaging highlights fluid and edema. In T2 images, fluids appear bright, and soft tissue contrast is well-differentiated. It is particularly useful for detecting abnormalities in tissues with high water content, such as inflammation, cysts, or tumors.\n",
    "    - STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery): STIR is a special type of T2-weighted sequence that suppresses the fat signal, making it easier to identify areas of edema or inflammation. It's commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging to assess conditions like bone marrow edema, soft tissue injuries, and other pathologies where fat suppression is important.\n",
    "2. **Sagittal T1**\n",
    "    - Sagittal Plane: As mentioned above, the sagittal plane divides the body into left and right sections.\n",
    "    - T1-weighted (T1): T1-weighted imaging provides good anatomical detail, particularly of fat-containing structures, which appear bright in T1 images. T1-weighted sequences are useful for evaluating anatomical structures, the integrity of tissues, and the presence of fatty lesions. T1 images are often used in conjunction with T2 images for a more comprehensive assessment of tissue contrast.\n",
    "3. **Axial T2**\n",
    "    - Axial Plane: The axial plane slices the body horizontally, dividing it into upper (superior) and lower (inferior) parts. Axial images are viewed as if looking from the feet upwards.\n",
    "    - T2-weighted (T2): As with sagittal T2, axial T2-weighted imaging highlights fluid and is useful for detecting pathology in cross-sectional views. Axial T2 images are often used to evaluate the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and surrounding soft tissues, as well as to assess brain and abdominal structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to sum things up:\n",
    "- Sagittal T2/STIR: Side view images with emphasis on fluid and inflammation, with fat signal suppression.\n",
    "- Sagittal T1: Side view images focusing on detailed anatomical structures with fat appearing bright.\n",
    "- Axial T2: Horizontal cross-sectional images highlighting fluid and pathology in the body.\n",
