On the other hand, selecting the topic for our project was more challenging for the same reason. We wanted to choose an engaging, challenging, relevant, and valuable topic with significant potential for *exploratory data analysis* (EDA). After a long and thorough search, we have stumbled upon the [\"Kaggle\"](https://www.kaggle.com) platform and found the [\"RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification\"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification) competition.\n"

    "At a medical level, the competition is about helping radiologists diagnose and classify spine degenerative conditions more accurately and efficiently. This can help improve the quality of life for patients with spine degenerative conditions and reduce the time and cost of the diagnosis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the current diagnosis process is very manual and time-consuming and requires a lot of expertise and experience from the radiologist. The radiologist needs to analyze the [MRI](#mri-imaging) images of the patient's lumbar spine and classify the different spine degenerative conditions and their severity. This process is very subjective and can be affected by the radiologist's experience, knowledge, and mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a technical specification level, the competition is about classifying lumbar spine [MRI](#mri-imaging) images into five spine degenerative conditions:\n",
    "1. Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing\n",
    "2. Right Neural Foraminal Narrowing\n",
    "3. Left Subarticular Stenosis\n",
    "4. Right Subarticular Stenosis\n",
    "5. Spinal Canal Stenosis\n",

    "Notice that the conditions are divided into two types:\n",
    "- [Neural Foraminal Narrowing](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24856-foraminal-stenosis)\n",
    "- [Stenosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_stenosis)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the conditions in the links above.\n",
    "\n",
    "From those conditions, we need to classify **where** the condition is visible between the different spine disc levels (vertebral disc levels): \n",
    "1. L1-L2\n",
    "2. L2-L3\n",
    "3. L3-L4\n",
    "4. L4-L5\n",
    "5. L5-S1\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we need to provide a severity score for the condition: \n",
    "1. Normal/Mild\n",
    "2. Moderate\n",
    "3. Severe\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to provide a classification for the severity of each condition and vertebral disc for each patient; therefore, we need to deliver 25 classifications with three classes each.\n",

    "Our data contains MRI images with the following sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sagittal T2/STIR**\n",
    "    - Sagittal Plane: This refers to the plane of imaging that divides the body into left and right halves. When imaging is done in the sagittal plane, the images show slices of the body from the side.\n",
    "    - T2-weighted (T2): T2-weighted imaging highlights fluid and edema. In T2 images, fluids appear bright, and soft tissue contrast is well-differentiated. It is particularly useful for detecting abnormalities in tissues with high water content, such as inflammation, cysts, or tumors.\n",
    "    - STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery): STIR is a special type of T2-weighted sequence that suppresses the fat signal, making it easier to identify areas of edema or inflammation. It's commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging to assess conditions like bone marrow edema, soft tissue injuries, and other pathologies where fat suppression is important.\n",
    "2. **Sagittal T1**\n",
    "    - Sagittal Plane: As mentioned above, the sagittal plane divides the body into left and right sections.\n",
    "    - T1-weighted (T1): T1-weighted imaging provides good anatomical detail, particularly of fat-containing structures, which appear bright in T1 images. T1-weighted sequences are useful for evaluating anatomical structures, the integrity of tissues, and the presence of fatty lesions. T1 images are often used in conjunction with T2 images for a more comprehensive assessment of tissue contrast.\n",
    "3. **Axial T2**\n",
    "    - Axial Plane: The axial plane slices the body horizontally, dividing it into upper (superior) and lower (inferior) parts. Axial images are viewed as if looking from the feet upwards.\n",
    "    - T2-weighted (T2): As with sagittal T2, axial T2-weighted imaging highlights fluid and is useful for detecting pathology in cross-sectional views. Axial T2 images are often used to evaluate the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and surrounding soft tissues, as well as to assess brain and abdominal structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to sum things up:\n",
    "- Sagittal T2/STIR: Side view images with emphasis on fluid and inflammation, with fat signal suppression.\n",
    "- Sagittal T1: Side view images focusing on detailed anatomical structures with fat appearing bright.\n",
    "- Axial T2: Horizontal cross-sectional images highlighting fluid and pathology in the body.\n",

    "The dataset in question contains almost 2000 cases (1975, to be exact). As a medical dataset, most cases fall under the **Normal/Mild** severity category, with fewer cases classified as **Moderate** severity and even fewer as **Severe** severity. This distribution is particularly noticeable in the **canal stenosis** category, where most cases are of normal/mild severity, with only a few classified as severe. It is crucial to account for this imbalance when training a model, as it may result in the model being biased toward predicting the Normal/Mild class more frequently than the Severe class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dataset comprises **15 distinct classes**. However, learning meaningful patterns across all classes is challenging due to **distribution shift** and **concept shift** in the data ( [you can read about them here](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-classification/environment-and-distribution-shift.html) ). To address this issue, we employ an established statistical method called [Ensemble Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning), using three distinct learning models and establishing relationships between them. The models will be combined by leveraging their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we use **stacking**, or **stacked generalization**, an advanced ensemble learning technique that integrates the predictions of multiple base models through a **meta-model** to enhance overall predictive performance. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simple voting or averaging, stacking uses a second-level model, the **meta-learner**, which optimally combines the outputs of the base learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Learners**: These are individual machine learning models trained on the same dataset. Each base learner may capture different patterns or aspects of the data, and employing a diverse set of models increases the variance within the ensemble.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Meta-Learner**: The meta-learner is responsible for synthesizing the predictions from the base learners. It takes these predictions (or probabilities) as input and produces the final prediction, effectively learning to weigh and integrate the base models' outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique allows us to address challenges posed by distribution and concept shifts. Initially, the base learners train on the entire dataset. Their predictions, generated on a validation set or through cross-validation, are then used as input for training the meta-learner. The meta-learner subsequently learns how to weigh best and combine these predictions to produce the final output, improving the overall performance of the ensemble.\n"

    "As we can see, the human body is unique and can have structural deformations and differences, causing the coordinates to spread more. This is a problem we will have to address; more deformations and unique changes in the spine mean higher error potential for the classification of those diseases ( even if the x and y values are more predictable when there is a disease). One way we could go about this is by reducing the generality of the machine learning model to make the common case more accurate, and we can do this by removing the most extreme point from our data. \n",
