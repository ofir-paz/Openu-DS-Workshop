On the other hand, selecting the topic for our project was more challenging for the same reason. We wanted to choose an engaging, challenging, relevant, and valuable topic with significant potential for *exploratory data analysis* (EDA). After a long and thorough search, we have stumbled upon the [\"Kaggle\"](https://www.kaggle.com) platform and found the [\"RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification\"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification) competition.\n"

    "At a medical level, the competition is about helping radiologists diagnose and classify spine degenerative conditions more accurately and efficiently. This can help improve the quality of life for patients with spine degenerative conditions and reduce the time and cost of the diagnosis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the current diagnosis process is very manual and time-consuming and requires a lot of expertise and experience from the radiologist. The radiologist needs to analyze the [MRI](#mri-imaging) images of the patient's lumbar spine and classify the different spine degenerative conditions and their severity. This process is very subjective and can be affected by the radiologist's experience, knowledge, and mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a technical specification level, the competition is about classifying lumbar spine [MRI](#mri-imaging) images into five spine degenerative conditions:\n",
    "1. Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing\n",
    "2. Right Neural Foraminal Narrowing\n",
    "3. Left Subarticular Stenosis\n",
    "4. Right Subarticular Stenosis\n",
    "5. Spinal Canal Stenosis\n",

    "Notice that the conditions are divided into two types:\n",
    "- [Neural Foraminal Narrowing](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24856-foraminal-stenosis)\n",
    "- [Stenosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_stenosis)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the conditions in the links above.\n",
    "\n",
    "From those conditions, we need to classify **where** the condition is visible between the different spine disc levels (vertebral disc levels): \n",
    "1. L1-L2\n",
    "2. L2-L3\n",
    "3. L3-L4\n",
    "4. L4-L5\n",
    "5. L5-S1\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we need to provide a severity score for the condition: \n",
    "1. Normal/Mild\n",
    "2. Moderate\n",
    "3. Severe\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to provide a classification for the severity of each condition and vertebral disc for each patient; therefore, we need to deliver 25 classifications with three classes each.\n",

    "Our data contains MRI images with the following sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sagittal T2/STIR**\n",
    "    - Sagittal Plane: This refers to the plane of imaging that divides the body into left and right halves. When imaging is done in the sagittal plane, the images show slices of the body from the side.\n",
    "    - T2-weighted (T2): T2-weighted imaging highlights fluid and edema. In T2 images, fluids appear bright, and soft tissue contrast is well-differentiated. It is particularly useful for detecting abnormalities in tissues with high water content, such as inflammation, cysts, or tumors.\n",
    "    - STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery): STIR is a special type of T2-weighted sequence that suppresses the fat signal, making it easier to identify areas of edema or inflammation. It's commonly used in musculoskeletal imaging to assess conditions like bone marrow edema, soft tissue injuries, and other pathologies where fat suppression is important.\n",
    "2. **Sagittal T1**\n",
    "    - Sagittal Plane: As mentioned above, the sagittal plane divides the body into left and right sections.\n",
    "    - T1-weighted (T1): T1-weighted imaging provides good anatomical detail, particularly of fat-containing structures, which appear bright in T1 images. T1-weighted sequences are useful for evaluating anatomical structures, the integrity of tissues, and the presence of fatty lesions. T1 images are often used in conjunction with T2 images for a more comprehensive assessment of tissue contrast.\n",
    "3. **Axial T2**\n",
    "    - Axial Plane: The axial plane slices the body horizontally, dividing it into upper (superior) and lower (inferior) parts. Axial images are viewed as if looking from the feet upwards.\n",
    "    - T2-weighted (T2): As with sagittal T2, axial T2-weighted imaging highlights fluid and is useful for detecting pathology in cross-sectional views. Axial T2 images are often used to evaluate the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and surrounding soft tissues, as well as to assess brain and abdominal structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to sum things up:\n",
    "- Sagittal T2/STIR: Side view images with emphasis on fluid and inflammation, with fat signal suppression.\n",
    "- Sagittal T1: Side view images focusing on detailed anatomical structures with fat appearing bright.\n",
    "- Axial T2: Horizontal cross-sectional images highlighting fluid and pathology in the body.\n",

Such variations could be due to typical differences in body structure, abnormalities, deformities, or degenerative changes. The diversity in the dataset could pose challenges in accurately identifying conditions such as spinal canal stenosis and neural foraminal narrowing, as the subtle variations in geometry between normal and pathological conditions can overlap.\n",

    "This analysis provides valuable insights into the progression and clustering of spine diseases, particularly focusing on conditions such as spinal canal stenosis, neural foraminal narrowing, and subarticular stenosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strong Correlations Between Adjacent Vertebral Levels**\n",
    "A key observation from the analysis is that adjacent vertebral levels exhibit stronger correlations in terms of disease severity. For instance, spinal canal stenosis at L2/L3 shows a moderate to strong correlation (0.46) with stenosis at L3/L4. This pattern suggests that when stenosis affects one spinal level, there is a notable likelihood of its presence at the adjacent level. This could indicate a common degenerative process affecting neighboring regions of the spine due to similar biomechanical or anatomical stressors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weaker Correlations Across Distant Levels**\n",
    "As the analysis moves across non-adjacent spinal levels, the correlation between conditions weakens significantly. For example, the correlation between spinal canal stenosis at L1/L2 and L5/S1 is notably low (0.05). This suggests that the presence or severity of conditions at one end of the spine may have little direct impact on the distant levels. This may reflect the localized nature of many degenerative processes, where disease progression is confined to specific regions unless systemic factors are at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moderate Correlations within Neural Foraminal Narrowing**\n",
    "Neural foraminal narrowing exhibits moderate correlations both within and across vertebral levels. For example, left and right neural foraminal narrowing at the same level tend to be moderately correlated, indicating that the condition may often affect both sides symmetrically. Moreover, there are moderate correlations between foraminal narrowing and spinal canal stenosis, particularly at levels like L3/L4. This relationship suggests that as spinal canal stenosis progresses, foraminal narrowing may also worsen, which can further exacerbate nerve compression and clinical symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High Correlations in Subarticular Stenosis Between Left and Right Sides**\n",
    "Subarticular stenosis demonstrates strong correlations between left and right sides at the same spinal levels. This is particularly evident in levels such as L3/L4 and L4/L5, where the condition seems to manifest symmetrically. This symmetry is an important observation as it may guide both diagnostic approaches and surgical interventions, ensuring that clinicians address bilateral stenosis even when symptoms may present more prominently on one side."
